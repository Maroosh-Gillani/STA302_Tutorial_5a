# STA302_Tutorial_5a
* This repository contains the files, scripts, and code used for STA302's webscraping tutorial.
* The article I chose is Wikipedia's "List of prime ministers of Australia".
* The code used to webscrape is a modified version of the code provided in the course textbook "Telling Stories with Data" https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/07-gather.html#prime-ministers-of-the-united-kingdom
